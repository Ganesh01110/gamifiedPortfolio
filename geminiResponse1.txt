This is an ambitious and creative project. Merging a professional portfolio with a 2D "Shadow Fight" aesthetic is a great way to demonstrate both your technical skills and your eye for design.

To make this **production-grade**, we need to move away from "simple scripts" and toward an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** or **State-driven** architecture.

## 1. Tech Stack Selection

For a high-performance, lightweight, and scalable web game portfolio:

* **Framework:** **Next.js 14/15** (App Router). Best for SEO on your "Normal View" and routing.
* **Game Engine:** **Phaser.js** or **PixiJS**. These are industry standards for 2D web games. Phaser is more beginner-friendly for "levels" and "physics."
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for the UI/Normal view and **Framer Motion** for the smooth transitions between the two views.
* **State Management:** **Zustand**. It’s much lighter than Redux for game states (health, points, character selection).
* **Backend:** **Resend** (for the contact form email) and **Supabase** (if you want to store high scores or visitor logs).

## 2. Character Creation (AI Prompts)

To get that "Shadow Fight" style (stylized silhouettes with glowing accents), I recommend using **Midjourney** or **Leonardo.ai**.

**Platform Recommendation:** **Leonardo.ai** (It has great "RPG Character" models and allows for easy background removal).

### The Prompts

> **Style Modifier:** "2D vector art, flat design, stylized silhouette, Shadow Fight 2 style, sharp edges, glowing neon accents, isolated on white background, high contrast."

* **The Painter (Frontend):** "A sleek warrior silhouette holding a glowing ethereal brush-blade. As he slashes, trails of glowing binary code and geometric UI shapes follow the blade. Cyan and Magenta neon accents."
* **The Architect (Backend):** "A stoic armored figure holding a glowing holographic scroll or map. Floating data nodes and gear symbols surround him. Deep amber and gold neon accents."
* **The Wizard (Devops):** "A hooded mystic figure. Floating around him are glowing 3D cubes (containers). He is casting a spell of blue light. Electric blue and white neon accents."

## 3. Enhanced Story & Script

Instead of just "entering college," let’s make the villain represent the **Problem** your projects solved.

* **Level 1 (The Chaos Bug):** A messy, glitchy cloud monster.
* **The Fight:** You don't just "hit" him. Your "attacks" are actually your skills.
* *Frontend Painter:* Slashes the "glitch" to reveal a clean UI.
* *DevOps Wizard:* Throws a "Docker Container" to trap the "Unstable Server" monster.


* **The Reward:** Defeating the boss "Deploys" the project. The treasure chest is actually a **Terminal** that scrolls the project details.

## 4. Code Logic & SOLID Principles

To make this "Professional Grade," we will treat the game as a set of decoupled systems.

### A. The Project Data (Open-Closed Principle)

Store your projects in a `projects.json`. Your code should be able to add a new project without changing the Game Engine code.

### B. The Combat Logic (Strategy Pattern)

Don't write a giant `if` statement for attacks. Use a strategy pattern where each character has an `AttackStrategy`.

```typescript
// Example of a Solid Strategy for attacks
interface AttackStrategy {
  execute(position: {x: number, y: number}): void;
}

class PainterAttack implements AttackStrategy {
  execute(pos) { /* Logic for brush slash + CSS particles */ }
}

class DevOpsAttack implements AttackStrategy {
  execute(pos) { /* Logic for throwing container + smoky effect */ }
}

```

### C. Error Handling

* **Asset Loader:** Wrap your Phaser/Pixi loaders in a `try-catch`. If a character image fails to load, provide a "Default Silhouette" so the site doesn't crash.
* **Form Validation:** Use **Zod** with **React Hook Form** for the contact section to ensure no "undefined" messages reach your email.

## 5. Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Step 1: The "Dual-Core" Setup

Create your Next.js project. Set up a shared layout that holds the "View Toggle." Use Framer Motion to slide the "Normal View" out and the "Game View" in.

### Step 2: The Static Layer (Normal View)

Build the 4 sections using Tailwind. Ensure the `projects.json` drives the project section. This ensures that even if the game fails to load on a slow phone, your portfolio is still functional.

### Step 3: The Selection Scene (Game View)

Build the character carousel. When a user hovers over "The Painter," use a CSS filter or a small Canvas animation to make the silhouette "glow."

### Step 4: The Game Engine (Combat)

Integrate Phaser.js.

1. **Load Assets:** Load your AI-generated characters.
2. **Input Manager:** Map Arrow/WASD keys to `Character.attack()`.
3. **Collision System:** When the weapon hits the "Villain" hitbox, trigger the "Smoky Effect" and reduce the `EnemyHealth` state in Zustand.

### Step 5: The "Treasure" (Project Reveal)

Once `EnemyHealth === 0`, trigger an animation. The villain dissolves, and a "Deployment Successful" message appears, opening a Modal with your project cards.

## Next Step

Would you like me to write the **Zustand Store** logic to manage the health and character state, or would you prefer the **React/Tailwind code** for the dual-view landing page?
