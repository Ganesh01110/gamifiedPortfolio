now focus on the monster spawnand fight dynamics like , in level one for every character there are 2 or 3 monsters are being spawn and they move towards the character and try to eliminate him (by attack), every attack of monster should cause the damage to charatcers health , and if the characters health goes to zero then game over 
but character also attack the monster i.e attack1 and attack2 by user and dodge 
ideal action by monster should 
spawn->monster1-runningToLeft.gif to attack user->monster1-readyToAttack.gif or monster1-jumpingToAttack.gif ->monster1-attack.gif -> if attack is successful then (health of hero decreases) if hero attacks (attack of hero successful health of monster decreases while no damage to hero) , if hero defends(painter-dodge.gif or architect-dodge.gif or wizard-dodge.gif or generalist-dodge.gif) then neither hero's nor monsters health decreases , if monster defend to heros attacks (no decrease in monster health)-> when monster health goes to zero then it screamsit should be removed from the screen 
similarly monster 2 has 2 attack mode , may be random (monster2-attack1Lefthand.gif, monster2-scream.gif to intimidate hero,)

in level 1 , 2 or 3 monster will come one after another to fight wth hero all dies level ends , a chest(box opens (no asset now so use an emoji for now) and details about a project being shown)

mobile responsiveness i.e for andriod the landing page and proffesional view is okay ,but for gamified view from character selection page i think it will be better if we keep the page rotated vertical to horizontal with a suggestion (rotate the phone to horizontal to play or for better experience) , and unlike the instruction pannel of control for game , there should be button for attack1, attack2 and dodge, walk in circular format like any mobile game (shadow fight or pubg style) , so analyse and say if its possible or not if possible prepare a implementaion plan/task.md to implement it 

i dont know how to deploy this , i never used vercel , as github action file is ready and the github repo i created and i just opened new vercel account now tell me step by step process what i have to do to deploy it ? or will it be automated/ mannual ??
do something like this everytime i push to github all the check happens i.e ci.yml and iff passed the new feature will be deployed in vercel automatically ..is it possible ??
