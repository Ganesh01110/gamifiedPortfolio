now all the previous requirements has been completed so i want to introduce different type of villains  for different types of character , 
painter:: (
    level1: 3-monster1(walk , attack1 and attack2 , scream/intimidate , dodge , die),
    level2: 2-monster2(walk , attack1 and attack2 , scream/intimidate , dodge , die)
)
architect::(
    level1: 2-monster1(walk, attack1 and 2 , scream, dodge , die)+1 monster4(walk, attack1(only) , dodge , die) ,
    level2: 2-monster4(walk, attack1 and attack2 , scream/intimidate , dodge , die)
)
devops-wizard::(
    level1: 2-monster1(walk, attack1 and 2 , scream, dodge , die)+1 monster3(walk, attack1(only) 
     , dodge , die) ,
    level2: 2-monster3(walk, attack1 and attack2 , scream/intimidate , dodge , die)
)
generalist(use the sage png for now)::(
    level1: 2-monster1(walk, attack1 and 2 , scream, dodge , die)+1 monster3(walk, attack1(only) , dodge , die) ,
    level2: 2-monster5(walk, attack1 and attack2 , scream/intimidate , dodge , die)
)

i already have assets (gif files in public > assets > monster >gif folder of monster3 and monster4 and monster5) , so accordingly update monsters.json adjust sound assests accorgingly

the levels should be made something like a strategy based on character selection the monster will be choosen , follow solid principle , open for more level and more monster , follow best developer practices

level sequence (currently in this pattern and after implementation also this sequence should be followed ):: ideal(should be):level 1 complete->game pauses and level clear popup comes ->clicking on box 1 project 1 reveal (closing that)->level clear popup of of level1 (with button to start level 2)->level 2 game with monster 2(2 monster with spawn delay) -> level 2 complete->game pauses and level clear popup comes ->clicking on box 1 project (2nd project) reveal (closing that)-> victory brief(final summary(should be mobile responsive) with back character selection button)

add a pause button top right corner next to quit button , on clicking which game will pause and a sound button near the monster reveal section in storyComponent.tsx , so player can toggle the game sounds on or off before entering the actual game
make these two buttons available in mobile also



i want the background image to be dynamic i.e not fixed for desktop and mobile(based on screen ratio) , so prepare a json to add thse background image (some i uploaded in cloudinary  use that i have given the list , also for fall back there has to a local image for background ...till background load dont start game as it will hamper the game experience)

also tell be how i can make the contact form of mine to be funtional is it resend api key is enough or i need to do something else or anything manually i have to do (as i have no idea) , i want on entering all the data and clicking on send button it should send the mail to my mail id and a success message should be displayed AND THE form itself clears after sending the message


BattleScene2.ts is working good so remove unneccesary files , i have added chestbox png(have to add in the place of 🎁 emoji for level end reward scene) and a dramaticrock png (you have to create a component where this png should give a  parallax effect in  level 2 like rock at random place in suspension mode oscilating up and down but when it touches the ground or the protagonist's attck touches it it destroys with a lighting effect disintigrating into smaller rocks) , do it and then i will manually check if its working or not
