till now whatever developement has done its working perfectly(stable till now) , so as i wants more update how can i manage the gitrepo i.e can i host 2 different branch for 2 different link in vercel , i want 2 branches a stable(initial level) and another is (advanced feature-multi viallain) , also i want o preserve previous works as have fear if anything goes wrong , how should i maintain/manage this  ?


It is a very smart move to separate your stable build from your experimental "Advanced Feature" development. This is a standard industry practice called **Feature Branching**.

Since you are using Vercel, this is actually very easy to manage. Vercel is designed to handle multiple branches and can even give you unique URLs for each one.

Here is the best strategy to maintain your project without fear:

---

## 1. The Branching Strategy

You should maintain two primary branches in your Git repository:

* **`main` (or `master`):** This is your **Stable** branch. It should only contain code that is 100% working. This is what your "Production" link will point to.
* **`advanced-features`:** This is your **Development** branch. You will commit all your new villain logic, axe mechanics, and experimental art here.

### To create the new branch:

Open your terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
git checkout -b advanced-features
git push -u origin advanced-features

```

## 2. Hosting 2 Different Links in Vercel

Vercel supports **Branch Domains**. You don't need two separate Vercel projects; you can host both branches from the same one.

1. **Production Link:** By default, Vercel connects your `main` branch to your primary URL (e.g., `my-game.vercel.app`).
2. **Preview Link:** Every time you push to the `advanced-features` branch, Vercel automatically generates a "Preview" URL.
3. **Permanent Branch Link:** You can go to **Project Settings > Domains** in Vercel and assign a specific domain (like `beta.my-game.vercel.app`) specifically to the `advanced-features` branch.

## 3. How to "Preserve" Previous Work (No Fear)

If you are worried about breaking things, follow these Git "safety net" rules:

### A. Tagging (The "Save Point")

Before you start the advanced features, create a **Git Tag**. This is like a "snapshot" in time that never changes, even if you delete branches.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0-stable -m "Original stable version before multi-villain update"
git push origin v1.0-stable

```

### B. Never Merge without Testing

Work on `advanced-features`. If it becomes a mess, you can simply delete that branch and go back to `main`. Your `main` branch remains untouched and "safe" until you explicitly decide to merge the new features into it.

### C. Use "Feature Branches" for specific Villains

If you want to be even safer, create a branch for *each* boss:

* `feat/devops-boss`
* `feat/backend-cobra`
Once one boss is finished and tested, merge it into `advanced-features`.

## 4. Summary Workflow

| Step | Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `git checkout main` | Stay on the safe version. |
| **2** | `git checkout -b advanced-features` | Create the "experimental" playground. |
| **3** | *Develop & Commit* | Build your new bosses/axes here. |
| **4** | `git push origin advanced-features` | Update the Vercel "Beta" link. |
| **5** | *Check Vercel* | Verify the new features work on the live Beta URL. |

**Would you like me to help you draft a specific "Release Note" or a `README` update for your new Advanced branch?**
