so inside public folder there are the assets folder where i had separate folders for architect, painter, monsters and wizard , and 2 background setting , 2 background should run one after another in different level , 
there are two monsters i have given , monster 1 and monster 2(some other monster i will introduce later per diffrent character but for now add these two common for all)
in level one each character has to face 2 or 3 monster 1 , which is less powerful than monster 2 , and in level 2 each character has to face 1 OR monster 2 , which is more powerful than monster 1 , each time a character passes one level gats more power ful , and as a reward a project of respective discipline will be shown.
i have given the gif files for each charater for walking , lunching attack(two type of attack , attack1 and attack 2 ), 
attack 2 is more brutal and dangerous for the monsters , a dodging sequence for dodging from attack of monsetrs and some character has auxilliary actions also

so according to that set the buttons (show the controls in screen as instruction for game control for user)i.e in top left or something like that ...and a back button at every point of game to navigate home (i.e toggle scene) , also attach the images to respective image div component to character selection from the assets folder


for proffesional view the project cards i want to add a bigger card on clicking those smaller card , where the description about the project , skills , and if multiple images avaible for that project then images will be shown in carousal manner , also a close button to close that popup (make that popup a component so every project card can use that), i had once created an portfolio with html,css and minimal js , i want to pick certain features from that like a trail of a circle follows the cursor and causes colour inversion , a criss cross div inside which some quotes are flowing slowly in a loop , i have attached the old portfolio github link here add those styles wherever you see fit while acting as a proffesional senior website designer

the walk level isnt fixed yet , in that case dont spawn them from any higher height that may be causing the problem , after character selection character only be spawned from invisible to visible on same height i.e the ground where(at the height level) he will stand , walk , run, fight and dodge the monster , monsters will also be spawn on same level(ground level as hero character) almost(+ or - 20 pixel to add some perspective) and will walk , run , jump from , land to attack , dodge and when die just dissapear thiis is the ground logic , like the real world


the game should look like 

level 1 : fight sequence between protagonist and monster 1 (3 monsters) with some spawn delay at same ground level , all monster defeated and the

level complete screen should be shown with some animation (while game pauses)and on clicking the box project card with details about one project should shown, when close button is clicked the project card and level complete pop up should be removed and game should resume

then level 2 should start: fight sequence with monster 2 (2 monsters, moree damage than monster 1 with the spawn delay between 2 monster), irrespective of the health of protagonist when 2 monsters die 

the level complete screen should be shown with some animation (while game pauses)and on clicking the box project card with details about one project should shown, when close button is clicked the scorll type pop up i.e brief about two projects will be shown with back to character selection button to the end


now: after level 1 complete-> game pauses and level clear popup comes ->clicking on box 1 project reveal (closing that)->level clear popup of of level1 -> clicking box 2nd project reveal (closing that)-> open chest (clicking that) -> victory brief(final summary with character selection button)

ideal(should be):level 1 complete->game pauses and level clear popup comes ->clicking on box 1 project 1 reveal (closing that)->level clear popup of of level1 (with button to start level 2)->level 2 game with monster 2(2 monster with spawn delay) -> level 2 complete->game pauses and level clear popup comes ->clicking on box 1 project (2nd project) reveal (closing that)-> victory brief(final summary(should be mobile responsive) with back character selection button)

as protagonist is jumping now , so add a jumping instruction and jump control(up arrow at left) for mobile
